# Web structure similarity calculation using three methods:

## TV algorithm: using this label vector method, counting how many times each
## possible tag appears convert the document D in a vector v(D) of fixed
## dimension N as the number of possible tags is limited.

## LCTS, the longest public tag sub-sequence method. ### The distance of two
## documents can be expressed based on their longest common tag subsequence.

## CTSS, public tag sequence shingle method. ### To overcome the computational
## costs of the previous distance method, this method uses shingling techniques.

# Description ## Each method can go to the paper to understand what the specific
# meaning. ## These methods are only used as a module for program processing.
